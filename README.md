# The Project
Surfbot was design and developed during the course *Advanced UI Design* at the [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/) platform. It is a clone from the original design by [Andr√© Rafael](https://github.com/origamid).

The goal of the project was to learn the principles of **UI design**, understand design principles, analyze several interface examples and see why each design decision was made. Then we cloned surfbot UI from the Wireframe using Figma, again going through all decisions and fundamentals used. By the end, I decided to implement it in real code. I also made the decision use only vanilla javascript.

## Languages and technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
